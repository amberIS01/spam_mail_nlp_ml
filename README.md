# 📧 Email Spam Classifier

Welcome to the **Email Spam Classifier** repository! 🚀

## 🎬 Running the Streamlit Application

This Email Spam Classifier comes with a user-friendly interface powered by **Streamlit**. Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. **Install Streamlit**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This command will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    This command will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your default web browser.

## 🛠️ Usage

1. **Enter the Message/Email**: Open the application and input the message or email you want to classify as Spam or Not Spam.
2. **Click Classify**: Hit the "Classify" button to initiate the classification process.
3. **Get the Result**: The model will provide the classification result, and you'll see if the message is identified as "Spam" or "Not Spam."

## 📊 Model Details

The Email Spam Classifier uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset of labeled emails. The model analyzes the text of the email and predicts whether it is spam or not based on various features.

### Features Used:
- **Word Frequency**: The frequency of certain words that are commonly found in spam emails.
- **Email Structure**: The structure and format of the email, including the presence of links, images, and attachments.
- **Sender Information**: Information about the sender, such as the email domain and sender reputation.

## 🧪 Testing

To ensure the accuracy of the classifier, the model has been tested on a separate validation dataset. The performance metrics include:
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified emails.
- **Precision**: The percentage of emails classified as spam that are actually spam.
- **Recall**: The percentage of actual spam emails that are correctly classified.
